Tips for the Best Tiramisu:
Dip ladyfingers one or two at a time. A quick dip on each side is enough. There will be some syrup left behind.
Do not over-soak the ladyfingers or the layers may collapse.
When whisking yolks and sugar over steam, make sure the bowl is not touching the water beneath it.
Beat the cold heavy whipping cream until medium peaks form (donâ€™t under beat or overbeat)
When working with Mascarpone, do not overmix the cream or it may turn grainy.
Chill the cake at least 6 hours in the refrigerator or overnight and it will be very easy to slice.
Tiramisu keeps well so you can make it a day or two ahead.
Leftovers are good refrigerated up to 5 days because there are no raw eggs in the cake.
