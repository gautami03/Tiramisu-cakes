How to Make Tiramisu:
Tiramisu is made of 2 basic components – the cream layer and the coffee-soaked ladyfingers. The process is simple:

Quickly dip half of the ladyfingers in coffee syrup and arrange in a 9×13 casserole
Combine 6 yolks and 3/4 cup sugar and continue whisking over a saucepan of simmering water for 9-10 minutes. Remove from steam and cool slightly.
Beat 16 oz mascarpone with 3 Tbsp rum then beat in the warm yolk mixture until blended.
Whip 2 cups cold heavy cream to medium peaks. With a spatula, fold half into the mascarpone mixture then fold in the remaining half until blended.
Spread half of the cream over the first layer of ladyfingers. Dip the remaining ladyfingers and arrange over the cream. Spread on remaining cream. Cover and refrigerate overnight then dust with cocoa powder and serve.
